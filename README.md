# NLP-Poet-Identification
 In this project, we first build language models for three prominent Persian poets, Ferdowsi, Hafez, and Rumi (Mowlana), based on the training data consisting of the poem verses from these poets. Then, for each poet we calculate the probability for each verse from our test data using these models in order to decide to which poet the given verses belong.
